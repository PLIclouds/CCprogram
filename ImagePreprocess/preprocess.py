class Request(object):
    """

    This class can be easy to use for some people who don't like to make more complex choice on the parameters of the algorithm but want to have a try.
    Clearly, it still work but not good enough! I recommend everyone to use it by downloading the folder "enhancement" and use it as whatever you like!

    But if you still want to try it, you can use it by the fellow steps:
        
        1. First you will put in the path of the FOLDER, which includes the pictures you'd like to process. If you write a wrong path, you have to check
           it and try again. 
        2. Next put in the method you want to use. Also, If you write a wrong name, you have to check it and try again. (Currently only support SSR and 
           MSR, which is introduced in detail in enhancement/retinex.py)
        3. Finally press any buttons in your keyboard to continue. But make sure you know that your original pictures will be covered and can NOT be 
           found later!!!

    Attributes:

        path: All picture in the targeted folder
        type: the way that picture is processed
